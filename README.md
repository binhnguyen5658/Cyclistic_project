# Cyclistic project

## About Cyclistic
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic have 3 pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members

## Scenario
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, they want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, marketing team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members
